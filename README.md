This repository contains the code and materials related to the computer vision project aimed at analyzing basketball game statistics. The project leverages computer vision and AI techniques to extract useful information from game videos, such as point counting, player detection, and other game metrics.

## Project Description

The project focuses on using computer vision algorithms to analyze video data from basketball games. Some of the main features include:

- **Players, Rims, Ball Detection**: By using object detection algorithms, the goal is to identify track players and find the position of ball and hoops on the court during a basketball game.

- **Point Counting**: Through event recognition, such as ball shooting and passing through the hoop, the system aims to automate the counting of points scored during the game.


## Contributions

The project was developed by Lorenzo Corradi, Marco Morini, and Filippo Bologna, students of Artificial Intelligence at UNIMORE.
